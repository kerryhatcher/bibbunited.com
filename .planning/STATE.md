## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Payload CMS 3.x runs inside Next.js process (single container, admin at /admin)
- Payload 2.x patterns/tutorials are outdated and must be avoided
- Tailwind CSS v4 config differs significantly from v3; verify scaffolding output
- [Phase 01-cms-foundation]: Manual project setup from Payload blank template (create-payload-app has TTY issues in automated environments)
- [Phase 01-cms-foundation]: @payloadcms/storage-local does not exist on npm; Payload uses local filesystem storage by default

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Payload 3.x is relatively new (GA late 2024); lean on official docs, not community tutorials
- Exact package versions should be verified with `npm view` before scaffolding
- Tailwind v4 may need manual setup if `create-payload-app` generates v3 config
